üêç Python Multi-Stage Deobfuscator (Tkinter GUI)A simple, graphical tool built with Tkinter for static analysis of Python malware that employs common multi-stage obfuscation techniques involving reverse string slicing, Base64 encoding, and Zlib compression/decompression.The tool automatically processes payloads chained in the typical format: exec((_)(b'...')).‚ú® FeaturesMulti-Stage Decryption: Automatically detects and loops through successive layers of reverse -> Base64 -> Zlib decompression.Graphical Interface: Uses the built-in Tkinter library for easy file browsing and clean output display.Non-Executional Safety: Analyzes the payload statically without ever executing the potential malicious code.Final Payload Export: Automatically saves the final, clear-text code to a file named payload.txt in the script's directory.Robust Pattern Matching: Includes fallback logic to find encoded payloads, even if the surrounding Python structure is slightly malformed or missing.üíª DependenciesThis tool uses only standard Python libraries.Python 3.6+base64zlibre (Regular Expressions)tkinter (Standard GUI library)osNo external pip install commands are required if you have a standard Python installation.üõ†Ô∏è Usage ManualFollow these steps to analyze an obfuscated Python script:1. Prepare the ScriptSave the provided deobfuscator code as a Python file (e.g., deobfuscator.py).Ensure the obfuscated Python code you want to analyze (the one-liner) is saved in a separate text file (e.g., malware_input.txt).2. Run the ToolOpen your terminal or command prompt and run the script:python deobfuscator.py
3. Analyze the FileBrowse: Click the Browse File üìÇ button in the graphical window.Select File: Navigate to and select your obfuscated input file (e.g., malware_input.txt).Deobfuscate: Click the Deobfuscate ‚ñ∂Ô∏è button.4. Review ResultsThe tool will immediately begin looping through the obfuscation stages:The output text box will display the clear-text payload for each sequential stage.When the process finishes, the final, clear-text script will be displayed, and a success message will appear.5. Payload ExportThe final decoded output (the most important stage) is automatically saved to a file named payload.txt in the same directory where you ran the deobfuscator.py script.
